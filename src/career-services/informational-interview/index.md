## Informational Interviews

An informational interview is an informal meeting between a job seeker and a potential employer connection the gives the job seeker an opportunity to seek career advice and learn more about a company's culture, while the employer connection gets an opportunity to get to know a potential candidate for hiring.

## How to Get an Informational Interview
- Keep the message short (letting them know you're looking for help early in the message)
- Be clear about why you are reaching out (Why did you reach out to them in particular?)
- Be clear about who you are (Consider things you have in common)
- Be specific and flexible in your ask (BE CONSIDERATE OF TIME)
- Consider the subject line (i.e. "Saw your article on LinkedIn, would love to connect")

Things to Avoid:
- Poor word choice (i.e. "Pick your brain"), [grammar and spelling](https://www.grammarly.com/) mistakes
- Canceling and/or rescheduling the interview once offered
- Bombarding the entire office because they do talk
- Forgetting to send a follow-up thank you for any response and/or interview
- Attaching your resume, this is supposed to be a more casual and comfortable conversation
- Not responding promptly and appropriately (casual and comfortable does not mean unprofessional)
