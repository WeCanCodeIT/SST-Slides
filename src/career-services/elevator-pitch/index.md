## Elevator Pitch
An elevator pitch is your opportunity to sell yourself effectively in a limited amount of time.

## Discussion Questions
- How have you made positive first impressions in the past, or had others make positive first impressions on you?
- How could the opportunity to briefly meet someone who could be influential in your career be a negative experience?  How can you avoid this?

## How-to Steps
Who are you professionally?
- Name
- Title
- Where you're contributing

Where have you been and what have you done?
- Previous professional experiences
- 1 way you brought value/accomplishment for each
  - Your value should be unique, something that makes you stand out
- What was your motivation for doing bootcamp and transitioning to tech?

What's next?
- What is your goal?
- What would you like to achieve next?
- Where do you want to go and how do you want to contribute?

General

## Things to Avoid

- Using the same version of your pitch regardless to your audience

## Example
Old Elevator Pitch:
“I’m a stay-at-home mom, and I’ve recently started doing web design.”

New Elevator Pitch:
“I’m a web designer who’s making the Internet a more beautiful and positive place! My background in counseling helps me understand what the bloggers and small business owners I work with need. And, thanks to working in administration, I’m great at coming up with solutions, no matter what you throw at me.”
