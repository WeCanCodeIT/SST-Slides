## How to Answer Behavioral Questions
**Step 1:** Describe the situation & task.

**Step 2:** Describe the action you took.

**Step 3:** Describe the result of your action.

## Tips for Answering
- Be specific about the facts of the situation.
- Keep to the main points.
- Focus on what YOU did, not your team.
- The situation and result should be succinct, and put the emphasis on the action you took.

Things to Avoid:
- Rambling.
- Not answering the question that was asked.
- Sharing a negative perspective.
- Speaking poorly of individuals or a company.
- Not clearly following the STAR structure.

## Sample Interview Questions
1. Give an example of a time when you used logic to solve a problem.
2. Give an example of a goal you reached and tell me how you achieved it.
3. Give an example of a goal you didn't meet and how you handled it.
4. Describe a stressful situation at work and how you handled it.
5. Have you ever been asked to complete a task that was not part of your job?
6. Have you ever had to work with a supervisor who was less qualified for the job than you?
7. What do you do if you disagree with your boss?

## Homework
Create a chart like the one below where you will fill it in with S.A.R. structured stories for each category for each job and project you have listed on your resume. Design this well so it can be used as a study guide tool for you during phone interviews and for prepping for in person interviews.
