## Activity Objective
- To help students understand how skills and traits they have gained from past experiences have prepared them for their next role in tech.
- To help students connect seemingly unrelated past experiences to valued skills and traits in tech for self-marketing.

## Directions (Part 1)
- Split into small groups (ideally 3-4 students per group)
- Make sure your group has sticky notes and a whiteboard or workspace where you can stick the sticky notes
- Proceed 1 at a time doing the following:
  - With their resume handy, have the first group member write out the following table and fill it in with the experiences (paid/unpaid).
  
| Experience 1 | Experience 2 | Experience 3 | Things You Value in Yourself |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------|
|              |              |              |                              |

  - For each experience, write a skill gained or trait gained through the experience (1 per sticky note) and place it in the corresponding experience column.
  - Talk through and explain these experiences to the group, and work together to help uncover other possible skills or traits.
  - Lastly, move sticky notes to the "Things You Value in Yourself" column, where appropriate.
  
## Directions (Part 2)
- Re-evaluate elevator pitch and resume within groups
- Make adjustments, and continuously get feedback from the group
