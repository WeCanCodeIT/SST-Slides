<p>In this session, students should all bring a copy of their current resume to class. We will be focusing on making some initial updates to the resume, so it’s ready for general purpose use. This will also serve as a guide for the following session on developing a strong LinkedIn profile.</p>

<ul>
  <li>[ ] Make a copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15enbNPsfgIxnn1h9U0ycjRZFZuECQ5HbhfZmuudsZpk/edit?usp=sharing">WCCI Starter Resume Template</a> on your Google Drive, saved as “(Your Name) Resume.  Share with your SSC!</li>
  <li>[ ] Enter your credentials where outlined in the template (Name, City, State, Contact Information, Online Presence, etc.)</li>
  <li>[ ] Determine whether you need a <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/resume-types-chronological-functional-combination-2063235">chronological, functional, or combination</a> resume (most will need combination, but it is worth reviewing your options and making certain you’re using the format that best serves your needs.</li>
  <li>[ ] Brainstorm &amp; write out a list of your most desirable, related qualifications (should form the cornerstone of your resume) This will include your tech stack (you’ll need to choose the list from your specific campus, available within the template resume) your projects and work at WCCI and any other programming experience, and other core competencies and strengths.  Make sure these shine in your content, by choosing projects that show your best work (don’t worry if you’re not there yet!) and quantifiable, demonstrable abilities and achievements from your work experience.</li>
  <li>[ ] Check out other resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and job postings for ideas of how best to market yourself and your abilities.</li>
  <li>[ ] Make sure you’ve created resume content to market yourself as a programmer.  Strengths and accomplishments from your past should be included where relevant, but shouldn’t detract from your current path.</li>

<h2 id="activity">Activity</h2>

<p>Objective: Students can learn to identify characteristics in a resume that will make them attractive (or off-putting) to potential employers.  This exercise should help give them ideas of what they will or won’t include in their resume, their preferences on aesthetics/layout of resume, etc.  Feedback from both classmates and instructors should help guide some of these decisions effectively.</p>

<p>Activity Instructions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Provide a few brief programmer/tech job descriptions (for back-end, front-end, full-stack) for students to review in groups.  Each group will act as the hiring team for these roles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide students access to several different resumes to review.  (insert link to sheet of selected resumes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ask students to identify which resumes they would invite for an interview for each position.  Based only on resume, who would they hire?  Why?  Each group shares out with the entire class about their choices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Specifically review resumes that were not selected for interviews or hires.  Why did students not feel these candidates were the best choices?  What about those resumes didn’t they like?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, review why the more popular resumes were preferred.  What impression of the candidates who submitted these resumes did the students have?  What did they like about how they showcased their skills?  About how they looked?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
