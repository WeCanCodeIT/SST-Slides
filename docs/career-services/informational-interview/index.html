<h2 id="informational-interviews">Informational Interviews</h2>

<p>An informational interview is an informal meeting between a job seeker and a potential employer connection that gives the job seeker an opportunity to seek career advice and learn more about a company’s culture, while the employer connection gets an opportunity to get to know a potential candidate for hiring.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-an-informational-interview">How to Get an Informational Interview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep the message short (letting them know you’re looking for help early in the message)</li>
  <li>Be clear about why you are reaching out (Why did you reach out to them in particular?)</li>
  <li>Be clear about who you are (Consider things you have in common)</li>
  <li>Be specific and flexible in your ask (BE CONSIDERATE OF TIME)</li>
  <li>Consider the subject line (i.e. “Saw your article on LinkedIn, would love to connect”)</li>
</ul>

<p>Things to Avoid:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Poor word choice (i.e. “Pick your brain”), <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">grammar and spelling</a> mistakes</li>
  <li>Canceling and/or rescheduling the interview once offered</li>
  <li>Bombarding the entire office because they do talk</li>
  <li>Forgetting to send a follow-up thank you for any response and/or interview</li>
  <li>Attaching your resume, this is supposed to be a more casual and comfortable conversation</li>
  <li>Not responding promptly and appropriately (casual and comfortable does not mean unprofessional)</li>
